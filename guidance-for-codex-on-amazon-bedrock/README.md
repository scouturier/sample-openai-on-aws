## Quick Start

This guidance integrates Codex with your existing OIDC identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, or Cognito User Pools) to provide federated access to Amazon Bedrock.

### What You Need

**Existing Identity Provider:**
You must have an active OIDC provider with the ability to create application registrations. The guidance federates this IdP with AWS IAM to issue temporary credentials for Bedrock access.

**AWS Environment:**

- AWS account with IAM and CloudFormation permissions
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions
- Python 3.10+ development environment for deployment

### What Gets Deployed

The deployment creates:

- IAM OIDC Provider or Cognito Identity Pool for federation
- IAM roles with scoped Bedrock access policies
- Platform-specific installation packages (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Optional: OpenTelemetry monitoring infrastructure

**Deployment time:** 2-3 hours for initial setup including IdP configuration.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for complete step-by-step deployment instructions.

## Architecture Overview

This guidance uses Direct IAM OIDC federation as the recommended authentication pattern. This provides temporary AWS credentials with complete user attribution for audit trails and usage monitoring.

**Alternative:** Cognito Identity Pool is also supported for legacy IdP integrations. See [Deployment Guide](assets/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for comparison.

### Authentication Flow (Direct IAM Federation)

![Architecture Diagram](assets/images/credential-flow-direct-diagram.png)

1. **User initiates authentication**: User requests access to Amazon Bedrock through Codex
2. **OIDC authentication**: User authenticates with their OIDC provider and receives an ID token
3. **Token submission to IAM**: Application sends the OIDC ID token to Amazon Cognito
4. **IAM returns credentials**: AWS IAM validates and returns temporary AWS credentials
5. **Access Amazon Bedrock**: Application uses the temporary credentials to call Amazon Bedrock
6. **Bedrock response**: Amazon Bedrock processes the request and returns the response

## Prerequisites

### For Deployment (IT Administrators)

**Software Requirements:**

- Python 3.10-3.13
- Poetry (dependency management)
- AWS CLI v2
- Git

**AWS Requirements:**

- AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to create:
  - CloudFormation stacks
  - IAM OIDC Providers or Cognito Identity Pools
  - IAM roles and policies
  - (Optional) Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks and Amazon CloudWatch dashboards
  - (Optional) Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Data Firehose resources
  - (Optional) AWS CodeBuild
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions

**OIDC Provider Requirements:**

- Existing OIDC identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, etc.)

- Redirect URI support for `http://localhost:8400/callback`

### For End Users

**Software Requirements:**

- AWS CLI v2 (for credential process integration)
- Codex installed
- Web browser for SSO authentication

**No AWS account required** - users authenticate through your organization's identity provider and receive temporary credentials automatically.

**No Python, Poetry, or Git required** - users receive pre-built installation packages from IT administrators.

### Supported AWS Regions

The guidance can be deployed in any AWS region that supports:

- IAM OIDC Providers or Amazon Cognito Identity Pools
- Amazon Bedrock
- (Optional) Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks and Amazon CloudWatch dashboards
- (Optional) Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Data Firehose resources
- (Optional) AWS CodeBuild

Both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) partitions are supported. See [AWS Partition Support](#aws-partition-support) for details.

### Bedrock Mantle and OpenAI Models

Codex on Amazon Bedrock uses **Bedrock Mantle** — AWS's native OpenAI-compatible endpoint that provides access to OpenAI models through Amazon Bedrock. During setup, you can select from the following models:

| Model ID | Description |
|---|---|
| `openai.gpt-5.4` | **Recommended default** |
| `openai.gpt-oss-120b` | GPT-OSS 120B |
| `openai.gpt-oss-20b` | GPT-OSS 20B |

Codex CLI is configured automatically via `~/.codex/config.toml` with `model_provider = "amazon-bedrock"`. Authentication is handled through the AWS profile set up by the installer — no API key required.

**Note:** OpenAI models on Bedrock are currently in limited preview. Available in US regions only: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2.

### Platform Support

The authentication tools support all major platforms:

| Platform | Architecture          | Build Method                | Installation |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Windows  | x64                   | AWS CodeBuild (Nuitka)      | install.bat  |
| macOS    | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Native (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Intel (x86_64)        | Cross-compile (PyInstaller) | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Universal (both)      | Universal2 (PyInstaller)    | install.sh   |
| Linux    | x86_64                | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| Linux    | ARM64                 | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |

**Build System:**

The package builder automatically creates executables for all platforms using PyInstaller (macOS/Linux) and AWS CodeBuild with Nuitka (Windows). All builds create standalone executables - no Python installation required for end users.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md#platform-builds) for detailed build configuration.

## AWS Partition Support

This guidance supports deployment across multiple AWS partitions with a single, unified codebase. The same CloudFormation templates and deployment process work seamlessly in both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) regions.

### Supported Partitions

| Partition | Regions | Use Cases |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **AWS Commercial** (`aws`) | All regions where Bedrock is available | Standard commercial workloads |
| **AWS GovCloud (US)** (`aws-us-gov`) | us-gov-west-1, us-gov-east-1 | US government agencies, contractors, and regulated workloads |

### How It Works

The guidance automatically detects the AWS partition at deployment time and configures resources appropriately:

**Resource ARNs:**
- CloudFormation uses the `${AWS::Partition}` pseudo-parameter
- Automatically resolves to `aws` or `aws-us-gov`
- Example: `arn:${AWS::Partition}:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*`

**Service Principals:**
- Cognito Identity service principals are partition-specific
- Commercial: `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud West: `cognito-identity-us-gov.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud East: `cognito-identity.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- IAM role trust policies automatically use the correct principal based on region

**S3 Endpoints:**
- Commercial: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`

### Deploying to AWS GovCloud

Follow the same [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions with your GovCloud credentials active. During `cxwb init`, select a GovCloud region (us-gov-west-1 or us-gov-east-1) and the wizard will automatically configure GovCloud-compatible models and endpoints.

**GovCloud-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Credentials:** GovCloud requires separate AWS credentials from commercial accounts
2. **Model IDs:** GovCloud availability for OpenAI models is not yet available — check AWS documentation for current status
3. **FIPS Endpoints:** Cognito hosted UI uses `{prefix}.auth-fips.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
4. **Managed Login:** Branding must be created for each Cognito app client

### Validation

After deployment, verify the correct partition configuration:

```bash
# Check IAM role ARN uses correct partition
aws iam get-role \
  --role-name BedrockCognitoFederatedRole \
  --region <region> \
  --query 'Role.Arn'

# Expected ARN formats:
# Commercial: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
# GovCloud: arn:aws-us-gov:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are fully backward compatible**

- Existing commercial deployments continue to work without modification
- CloudFormation updates can be applied to existing stacks
- No changes to user-facing functionality
- No data migration required

## What Gets Deployed

### Authentication Infrastructure

The `cxwb deploy` command creates:

**IAM Resources:**

- IAM OIDC Provider (for Direct IAM federation) or Cognito Identity Pool (for legacy IdP)
- IAM role with trust relationship for federated access
- IAM policies scoped to:
  - Bedrock model invocation in configured regions
  - CloudWatch metric publishing (if monitoring enabled)

**User Distribution Packages:**

- Platform-specific executables (Windows, macOS ARM64/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64)
- Installation scripts that configure AWS CLI credential process
- Pre-configured settings (OIDC provider, model selection, monitoring endpoints)

### Distribution Options (Optional)

After building packages, you can share them with users in three ways:

| Method                | Best For               | Authentication                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual Sharing**    | Any size team          | None                           |
| **Presigned S3 URLs** | Automated distribution | None                           |
| **Landing Page**      | Self-service portal    | IdP (Okta/Azure/Auth0/Cognito) |

**Manual Sharing:** Zip the `dist/` folder and share via email or internal file sharing. No additional infrastructure required.

**Presigned URLs:** Generate time-limited S3 URLs for direct downloads. Automated but requires S3 bucket setup.

**Landing Page:** Self-service portal with IdP authentication, platform detection, and custom domain support. Full automation with compliance features.

See [Distribution Comparison](assets/docs/distribution/comparison.md) for detailed setup guides.

### Monitoring Infrastructure (Optional)

Enable usage visibility with OpenTelemetry monitoring stack:

**Components:**

- VPC and networking resources (or use existing VPC)
