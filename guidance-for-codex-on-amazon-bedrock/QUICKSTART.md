# Guidance for Codex on Amazon Bedrock

Run [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) against [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) with enterprise-grade identity, optional quota enforcement, and optional observability.

This guidance provides two deployment patterns — choose the one that matches your organization's needs for budget enforcement.

---

## Choose Your Pattern

**Start with this decision tree:**

```
Question 1: Do you need HARD quota enforcement?
(Blocking requests when users hit limits, not just alerts)

├── YES → LLM Gateway
│         Why: IdC cannot block requests mid-session
│
└── NO → Question 2: Already use AWS IAM Identity Center?

          ├── YES → Native AWS Access
          │         (Fastest: 5 min setup)
          │
          └── NO → Choose one:

                    Option A: Native AWS Access (Set up IdC + SAML)
                    • Pro: Native AWS integration
                    • Con: 30-60 min one-time setup

                    Option B: LLM Gateway (Use Gateway + OIDC)
                    • Pro: 15 min setup, no IdC needed
                    • Con: Additional infrastructure required
```

**Key Decision Factors:**

1. **Hard quotas require Gateway** — IdC issues credentials directly to users; AWS cannot revoke them mid-session
2. **If you have IdC already** — Native AWS Access is fastest (5 minutes)
3. **If you don't have IdC** — Choose between setting up IdC (native AWS integration) vs. Gateway (faster setup)

---

## Pattern Comparison

| Capability | Native AWS Access | LLM Gateway |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Authentication** | SAML → IdC | OIDC → Gateway |
| **IAM Identity Center Required?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Path to Bedrock** | Codex → Bedrock (native AWS SDK) | Codex → Gateway → Bedrock |
| **Developer Command** | `aws sso login` | `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` |
| **Per-user CloudTrail Audit** | ✅ Native | ✅ Gateway logs |
| **Hard Budget Limits** | ❌ No | ✅ Provided by gateway |
| **Per-team Quotas** | ❌ No | ✅ Provided by gateway |
| **Rate Limiting (RPM/TPM)** | ❌ No | ✅ Provided by gateway |
| **Model Routing/Fallback** | ❌ No | ✅ Provided by gateway |
| **Setup Time** | 5-60 min | 15 min |

## Native AWS Access

> **"Codex on Bedrock with corporate SSO. No API keys, no custom binaries."**

### Who This Is For

- ✅ Organizations already using AWS IAM Identity Center
- ✅ Teams willing to set up SAML federation (30-60 min one-time setup)
- ✅ Environments where soft monitoring (alerts, not blocking) is sufficient
- ❌ NOT for: Hard budget enforcement or FinOps-controlled environments

### What Developers Experience

1. Run `aws sso login` — browser opens to corporate login page
2. Authenticate with existing credentials (Okta, Azure AD, Google, etc.)
3. Use Codex normally — credentials handled automatically by AWS CLI

**No custom executables. No credential helpers. No Python required.**

### Architecture

```
Corporate IdP (Okta/Azure) → SAML → IAM Identity Center → AWS credentials → Bedrock
                                                              ↓
                                                     CloudTrail attribution
```

### What Gets Deployed

- IAM role with Bedrock model invocation policy
- IAM Identity Center permission set (if not already configured)
- Developer bundle: bash scripts + config snippets (~15 KB)

### Quick Start

**→ [docs/QUICKSTART_NATIVE_AWS_ACCESS.md](docs/QUICKSTART_NATIVE_AWS_ACCESS.md)**

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS account with IAM and CloudFormation permissions
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions
- Identity provider with SAML 2.0 support (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- AWS CLI v2 installed

**Deployment time:** 5 minutes (if IdC already set up) or 30-60 minutes (initial IdC setup)

---

## LLM Gateway

### Who This Is For

- ✅ Organizations that need hard per-user/per-team budget limits
- ✅ Teams where FinOps or platform team controls AI spend
- ✅ Environments requiring rate limiting (RPM/TPM enforcement)
- ✅ Organizations that don't use IdC and don't want to set it up

### What You Get

Capabilities depend on the gateway you deploy. Most OpenAI-compatible gateways provide:

- **OIDC / SSO authentication** — developers authenticate against your IdP
- **Per-user and per-team budgets** — gateway tracks spend and blocks when limits hit
- **Rate limiting** — requests per minute (RPM) and tokens per minute (TPM)
- **Model access policies** — control which teams can use which models
- **Cost attribution** — per user, team, or department for chargeback
- **Centralized policy management** — update limits without touching developer machines
- **Built-in telemetry** — gateways typically emit their own metrics, spend logs, and traces

### Architecture

```
Corporate IdP (Okta/Azure) → OIDC/JWT → LLM Gateway → Bedrock
                                              ↓
                                        Quota / rate limiting
                                        Cost attribution
                                        Model routing
```

### Gateway Choices

Any OpenAI-compatible gateway works — **[LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/)**, **[Portkey](https://portkey.ai/)**, **[Bifrost](https://github.com/Bifrost-AI/bifrost)**, **[Kong AI Gateway](https://konghq.com/products/kong-ai-gateway)**, **[Helicone](https://helicone.ai/)**, the [AWS Bedrock Gateway sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway), or a custom FastAPI shim. Choose whichever matches your operational posture.

This repository ships **LiteLLM** as a reference implementation under `deployment/litellm/` — the `cxwb` wizard deploys it on ECS Fargate. If you bring your own gateway, point developers at it via the wizard's "BYO gateway" path.

### What Gets Deployed (Reference Implementation)

When `cxwb` deploys the LiteLLM reference:

- VPC with public/private subnets (or use existing VPC)
- ECS Fargate cluster running the gateway
- Application Load Balancer for ingress
- RDS Postgres for gateway state
- Developer bundle: config snippets + gateway URL (~8 KB)

## Migration Notes

### Native AWS Access → LLM Gateway

**This is NOT a configuration change — it requires re-deployment.**

| Aspect | Changes Required |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Authentication** | Switch from SAML (IdC) to OIDC (Gateway) |
| **IdP Setup** | Create new OIDC app in your IdP |
| **Developer Workflow** | Change from `aws sso login` to API key |
| **Codex Config** | Change `model_provider` from `amazon-bedrock` to `openai` |
| **CloudTrail** | Attribution changes from per-user to gateway IAM role |

**Migration time:** 2-4 hours infrastructure + 1 hour per 10 developers for reconfiguration

**Best practice:** Test with pilot group (5-10 users) before org-wide rollout

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Team, Already Use IdC
**Recommended:** Native AWS Access

- Setup time: 5 minutes
- Cost: $0
- Why: Fastest, leverages existing infrastructure

### Scenario 2: Mid-Size Team, Need Budget Control
**Recommended:** LLM Gateway

- Setup time: 15 minutes
- Cost: ~$100-150/month
- Why: Only way to enforce hard quotas

### Scenario 3: Startup, No IdC, No Budget for Gateway
**Recommended:** Native AWS Access (set up IdC)

- Setup time: 30-60 minutes (one-time)
- Cost: $0
- Why: Clean architecture, no ongoing costs

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I migrate from Native AWS Access to LLM Gateway later?**

Not without re-deployment. LLM Gateway uses different authentication (OIDC vs. SAML) and routing architecture (Gateway vs. direct Bedrock). If you anticipate needing quotas within 12 months, start with LLM Gateway.

**Do developers need to install anything?**

- Native AWS Access: AWS CLI v2 (if not already installed)
- LLM Gateway: Nothing (web-based authentication)

**Does LLM Gateway add latency?**

Yes, single-digit milliseconds (typically <10ms) as requests route through the gateway. Not noticeable for Codex use cases.

**What does the reference LLM Gateway cost to run?**

~$100-150/month for AWS infrastructure (ECS Fargate ~$70, ALB ~$20, RDS Postgres ~$30). Gateway licensing depends on the product you choose — review each vendor's pricing.

**Are AWS GovCloud regions supported?**

Yes. Both patterns support AWS GovCloud (US) and commercial regions where Bedrock is available.
